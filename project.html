              <p>Pizza is more than just food; it’s a way of life. As they say, 
                “You can’t make everyone happy; you’re not pizza.” A slice a day 
                might not officially keep the doctor away, but it surely keeps 
                the sad away. In a world full of challenges, pizza is the only 
                love triangle anyone would want to be part of. After all, “In 
                pizza we crust.” There’s something undeniably comforting 
                about it—“Life happens, but pizza helps,” and when it comes 
                to bringing people together, “Home is where the pizza is.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sometimes, it feels like pizza is the answer, no matter the question. Happiness might be hard to buy, but “Money can buy pizza, and that’s kind of the same thing.” In times of celebration,
                 stress, or just any random Tuesday, pizza is there, reminding 
                 us that “Any time is a good time for pizza.” So next time life 
                 gets overwhelming, remember: “All you need is pizza and a little
                  bit of cheese.”</p>
